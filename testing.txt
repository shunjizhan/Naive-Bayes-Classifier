This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.	1
No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.	0
The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.	0
The ending, as in "Miracle," is not some Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.	1
