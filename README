p(1)*log(sum P(words | 1)) ==> change to log(p(1) + sum P(words | 1)), since the previous one take too many account for p(1), that was why the result was always the same.

found the weight too much in the situation that one word only appear in positive comment or negative comment, I changed /1000 to /10, so a simple word doensn't influence the result too much.

Wrote another python file that can change to parameters, for example change the stop words number (which is read from a file that contains 1000 most common words), I found 75 is will reach the best accuracy.
